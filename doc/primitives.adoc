== Primitive types

Primitive types are types for terminal fields, that can be combined using the typedef
constructs to define derived types.

With the exception of the pre-defined *void* type, which has size 0, all primitive types
have size 1, where the *size of a type* is the number of terminal fields it has.

=== Pre-defined primitive types

A mould set, when created, has the following primitive types defined in it:

* Lua's native http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.1[*basic types*]
(with the exception of *nil*),

* the *void* type (a type having no values),

* a few constrained numeric types (*bit*, *char*, *short*, *int*, etc.), and

* the *bitstr* and *hexstr* types (strings representing binary and hexadecimal data).


The full list of pre-defined primitive types, and a description of the values they admit,
can be found in the tables below.

=== Custom primitive types

Additional primitive types may be added to a mould set by means of the 
<<primitive,*primitive*>>( ) method described below. A primitive type must
have size 1, and a check function must be provided for it.

[[primitive]]
* *primitive* (_ms_, _name_, _checkfunc_) +
 +
Defines, in the mould set _ms_, an additional primitive type named _name_ (a string).
The _checkfunc_ argument must be a function accepting a value and returning _true_ if it
is a valid value for the newly defined type, or _false_ otherwise. 

.Example: a custom primitive numeric type, constrained between 0 and 1
[source, lua]
----
ms = moulds.new()

local function check_mynumber(x)
   return type(x)=="number" and x>=0 and x<1
end

ms:primitive("mynumber", check_mynumber)
