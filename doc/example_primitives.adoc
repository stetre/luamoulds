=== Primitive types

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/primitives

This short example shows how the <<pset, *pset*>>( ) and <<pget, *pget*>>( ) methods
can be conveniently used instead of <<tset, *tset*>>( ) and <<tget, *tget*>>( ), when
operating on instances of <<_primitive_types, primitive types>>.

Since primitive types (except for the _void_ type, which can not be accessed) have only
one terminal field in them, the two methods do not require the caller to specify a field name. 

The example also shows how to define custom primitive types with the
<<primitive, *primitive*>>( ) method.

The script for this example is in the `examples/primitives/` directory.
