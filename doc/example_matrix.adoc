=== Multidimensional arrays

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/matrix

This example shows how LuaMoulds can be used to create multi-dimensional arrays.

Of course this method is not suited for large and sparse arrays (because instances of
LuaMoulds types always have a value for each terminal field), but otherwise it has
some advantages like, for example, built-in boundary checks and type-checking. 

The script for this example is in the `examples/matrix/` directory.
