=== Safe access

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/safe

In this example, an error is deliberately caused by trying to write an invalid
value in a terminal field with the <<tset, *tset*>>( ) method. This method is 
'safe', in that it checks that the value is consistent with the field's type
and if it is not, it raises an error.

The script for this example is in the `examples/safe/` directory.
